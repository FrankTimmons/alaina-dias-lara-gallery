## Description

This site is a work in progress client project for a local artist who wanted to have an online presence.  I built this from the ground up using Next.js, Talwind, Sanity, and Stripe.  This has been a great learning experience for me. I feel I've been able to communicate with my client and deliver what she needs very effectively.
